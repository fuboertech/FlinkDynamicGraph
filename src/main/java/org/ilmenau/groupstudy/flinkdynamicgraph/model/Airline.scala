/**
    Airline ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline.
    Name		Name of the airline.
    Alias		Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".
    IATA		2-letter IATA code, if available.
    ICAO		3-letter ICAO code, if available.
    Callsign	Airline callsign.
    Country	Country or territory where airline is incorporated.
    Active		"Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".
